Rotate helices around other helices! Impress your friends, spite your enemies!

# Molten Globule Ensemble (Generator): MoGlE

Given an aminoacid sequence and the residues that form alpha helices, this package generates a large set of "molten globule" conformations, which can then be used in modelling, as starting structures, or in Molecular Dynamics simulations. It is very simple from a math point of view, in that it only uses simple rotation matrices.

In order to run it, you will need:

- MDTraj 1.9.7
- NumPy 1.21.5
- AmberTools 21.12
- SciPy 1.8.1
